**CS61BL Data Structures Project**

**Overview**
This project is a hands-on Java implementation of core data structures and algorithms. The goal was to understand how common structures actually work under the hood by building them from scratch, rather than relying on built-in libraries.

The focus throughout the project was on writing clean, correct code and making thoughtful decisions about efficiency and structure.

**What I Built**
I implemented several foundational data structures and the logic around them, including:
- Linear data structures with full support for insertion, removal, and edge-case handling
- Hash-based storage with collision handling and efficient lookup behavior
- Graph representations and traversal logic
- Algorithmic solutions designed with time and space complexity in mind

Each component was tested and refined to ensure it behaved correctly across a wide range of inputs.

**Tech Stack**
- Language: Java  
- Concepts: Data structures, algorithms, abstraction, performance tradeoffs  

**Design Approach**
I focused on keeping the code modular and readable, with clear interfaces between components. When tradeoffs came up, I prioritized clarity and correctness first, then optimized for performance where it mattered.

**What I Learned**
Working on this project helped me get much more comfortable reasoning about algorithms, debugging complex logic, and understanding how small implementation choices can have a big impact on performance and reliability.

**Additional Context**
This repository is meant to showcase implementation and problem-solving skills rather than serve as a production-ready library. I’m open to walk through design decisions or explain how specific components work.
